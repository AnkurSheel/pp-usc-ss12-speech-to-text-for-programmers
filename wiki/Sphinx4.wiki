#summary This page provides basic information on Sphinx-4.

= Introduction =

Sphinx-4 was developed through the collaboration of individuals and groups at Carnegie Mellon University, Sun Microsystems Laboratories, Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, and Hewlett Packard. Contributors also included individuals from UCSC and MIT.

Sphinx-4 is a flexible system for integrating various recognition tasks involving the perception of speech. It supports standardized forms of language model architecture and acoustic model architecture, including the Java Speech API Grammar Format (JSGF) from the Java Speech API.

The speech recognizer implemented in Sphinx-4 is probabilistic, making it ill-suited to recognizing the entire body of words necessary for broad sentence-level speech recognition. Its implementation is therefore limited in scope to a series of commands and tags that is finite in size.
